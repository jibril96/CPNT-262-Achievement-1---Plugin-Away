# Code Journal

* I haven't done any js before.

* Eventually i will get used to it.

* usually i google specific questions i have outside of class.

* And the tutorials are quite helpful.

* I observed that it's possible to have many data types within same arrays of strings.

* For example: Const colors = ['red', 'oranges', 10, true] 

* Arrays are always zero based.
